üí∞ The Real Cost of No-Shows:

For a practice with an average production of $200 per appointment:
‚Ä¢ 1 no-show per day = $52,000 lost annually
‚Ä¢ 2 no-shows per day = $104,000 lost annually
‚Ä¢ 3 no-shows per day = $156,000 lost annually

EasyParle reduces no-shows by 20%+ through automated reminders and easy confirmation.

That's not an expense - it's an investment with measurable returns.
